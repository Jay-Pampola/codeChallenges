            Let's get a little bit of practice with heading and paragraph elements. 
            In the index.html file, you'll find some starter text.  Please add in 
            the appropriate paragraph and heading elements to recreate what is shown in this image:

        <h1>Pangolin</h1>

        <h2>Intro</h2>

        <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
            "horny
            scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises
            the four
            species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan
            Africa. These
            species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.
        </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with
            this
            feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their
            diet
            consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
            animals,
            meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.
        </p>

        <h2>Poaching</h2>

        <p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese traditional
            medicine) and
            heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
            January 2020,
            of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as
            critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as
            endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List
            of
            Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

            3x3 table with a row of headings at the top, using the correct semantic elements. 
            You are expected to use the following elements: table, thead, tr, th, tbody, and td-->
